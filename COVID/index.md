title: Biocomplexity Resources for 2019-nCoV Epidemic Response
---

The Novel 2019 Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a rapidly spreading epidemic that originated in Wuhan, China. Because there are so many unknowns -- where it came from, how long it incubates, and when during the incubation people become contagious –- data collection has been a challenge, making it difficult for researchers to identify effective interventions. In addition, the rapid spread of the disease, when coupled with the elevated death rate, is raising public anxiety, which opens the door to disinformation campaigns and conspiracy theories, as well as misinformation about effective strategies for avoiding illness.

The Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing laboratory (NSSAC) has established this page as a workspace where data from multiple sources can be shared, along with our own curated datasets and simulations, to promote research that will hopefully bring the 2019-nCoV outbreak to a speedy end. Visitors can find open datasets and results of social media monitoring, along with modeling updates and other relevant information. In addition, we are developing visualization and other analytical tools to help researchers better understand the scope of the epidemic.

As part of this effort, NSSAC will be releasing several synthetic populations to the larger academic community to aid in the epidemic response. These data sets will include populations, locations, activities and contact graphs for each of the United States of America, in addition to other countries as time allows.

### Why use modeling for 2019-nCoV?
Modeling disease outbreaks can provide epidemic forecasts that explain the complex dynamics of infectious diseases. Simulation and modeling can predict the likely impact of possible interventions before they are implemented. As a result, policy makers and public healthcare workers are provided with measurable guidance and support.


In an effort to support planning and response efforts to the recent Corona Virus outbreak,
the [Network Systems Science and Advanced Computing (NSSAC)](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/nssac)
division of the [Biocomplexity Institute and Initiative](https://biocomplexity.virginia.edu/) 
at the [University of Virginia](https://www.virginia.edu/) has prepared a visualization tool that provides a complementary perspective to 
[2019-nCoV Global Cases by Johns Hopkins CSSE](https://gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/bda7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6).
We hope this tool will encourage researchers world-wide to explore the surveillance datasets 
being made available by [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html), [ECDC](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/geographical-distribution-2019-ncov-cases), [NHC](http://www.nhc.gov.cn/yjb/s3578/new_list.shtml), and [DXY](https://3g.dxy.cn/newh5/view/pneumonia), and curated by [JHU](https://systems.jhu.edu/research/public-health/ncov/). 
Using the [2019-nCoV Surveillance Dashboard](http://ncov.bii.virginia.edu/dashboard/), researchers can:
- View all incidence data, filtered by date and data range
- View heatmap of disease prevalence on an interactive map 
- Query data based on topics of interest 
- **Select neighboring regions based on user selection**
- Export subsets of the data for analysis on external tools 
 
The current version of the tool is a beta release; we will be providing updates on the tool as well as to the datasets. 
Please report any suggestions, bug reports, or additional data sources you think we should consider 
by contacting nssac_ncov_support at virginia.edu.
